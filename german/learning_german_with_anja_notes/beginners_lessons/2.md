| Wie heißt du?       | What is your name? _(informal)_ |
| Wie heißen Sie?     | What is Your name? _(formal)_   |
| Mein Name ist [...] | My name is [...]                |

"Who are you?" is not considered to be rude in german, even is it may sound like that. While asking `Wie ist du name?` is not so common, it is important to use the `Wie`, "How", instead of `Was`, "What", since it could be considered rude.

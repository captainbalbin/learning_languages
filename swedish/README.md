## Resources

This is based on Sfi's _Svenska f√∂r alla_ / _Swedish for all_ which can be found [here](https://swedish-for-all.se/sfi-steg-learning-steps/). Why does this exists you may ask? Well, the reason is that I always have a hard time finding ways to learn langauges withough being robbed or limited in access.

Future resources may be added here.

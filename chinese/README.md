# Chinese 中文 (Mandarin)

## Resources

I'm basing currently most of the resources on Fluten Forever's tips and tricks. Not particularly the app (since it does not support Chinese at the momen of writing this), and also to create my own source of learning.

- [The Fluent Forever book](https://fluent-forever.com/book/)
- [Article about Japanese and Chinese Logograms](https://blog.fluent-forever.com/logograms/)

- [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/) for memorising.

- [Pronunciation Trainer](https://fluent-forever.com/product/fluent-forever-pronunciation-trainer/)

- Chinese Radical: [All](https://www.yellowbridge.com/chinese/radicals.php) and [100 most common](https://www.hackingchinese.com/kickstart-your-character-learning-with-the-100-most-common-radicals/#table)

## The Plan

1. **Pronunciation:** I will be using the [Pronunciation Trainer](https://fluent-forever.com/product/fluent-forever-pronunciation-trainer/) to get used to the sounds and the "alphabet".

2. **Radicals:** I'm going to learn the 100 most used radicals based on [this](https://www.hackingchinese.com/kickstart-your-character-learning-with-the-100-most-common-radicals/#table). Full list of radicals can be found [here](https://www.yellowbridge.com/chinese/radicals.php). Mnemonics are going to be used to connect words to obects, which is described in the book's chapter about mnemonics. [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/) can be used to memorise them.

3. **625 Simple Words:** Next is the infamous list that can be used to get a basic vocabulary. In this step it's recommended when you find a charachter that has unfamiliar radicals, new mnemonics should be added.

4. **Grammar:** When knowing the sounds, pronounciations, charachters and the 625 words, grammar should be much easier to tackle.
